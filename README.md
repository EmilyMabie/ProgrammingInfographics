Images to guide beginners on the path of Web Development

Sometimes, when I'm learning a concept of coding and programming, I spend a great deal of time searching for a resource that's visual and well-organized to use as a guide while I build my muscle-memory. Often, that resource doesn't exist.
Enter: my DIY infographics. I hope they're as useful to you as they are to me!
